0. Write a Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of web_static. It must:

Install Nginx if it not already installed
Create the folder /data/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/shared/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
Create a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
Create a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
Give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group.
Update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of /data/web_static/current/ to hbnb_static (ex: https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
Use alias inside your Nginx configuration
Tip
Your program should always exit successfully. Don’t forget to run your script on both of your web servers.
1. Write a Fabric script that generates a .tgz archive from the contents of the web_static folder of your AirBnB Clone repo, using the function do_pack.

Prototype: def do_pack():
All files in the folder web_static must be added to the final archive
All archives must be stored in the folder versions (your function should create this folder if it doesn’t exist)
The name of the archive created must be web_static_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.tgz
The function do_pack must return the archive path if the archive has been correctly generated. Otherwise, it should return None
